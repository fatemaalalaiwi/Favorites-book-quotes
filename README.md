### Here are some details about the implementation of my project


**1. Database Design (ERD)**

This ERD shows the main tables in the project and how they are related to each other  
It shows the main entities such as **Books**, **Quotes**, and **Users**, along with their relationships and key attributes.

You can view the detailed ERD image below or click [here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d7384785-3b0a-4475-a6c2-22dd6ae056c0/edit?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_7c572d3d-2d40-478f-8e6e-b9dcc741fc01#) to see the full diagram online.

**2 . 📋 Project Planning with Trello**

At the srart of the project, i created a task plan using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/fjbBzWnu/project-02) , which helped me save time and stay organized.
Trello allowed me to clearly arrange and manage tasks visually, making the development process more efficient — as shown in the image below

**3. 🎨 Initial Design with Figma**

After planning, I created a basic design for the project using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/deck/gTX2Pksl2IoOuTrAZm6G1B/Untitled?node-id=1-30&t=UQyWEEWZXdkjPOkz-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1) .
This step helped me visualize the layout and understand how I wanted the structure and interface of my project to look — as shown in the image below
